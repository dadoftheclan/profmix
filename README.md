## üìñ Overview

ProfMix is a Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application designed to simplify the process of mixing voice recordings with background music. It's ideal for creating high-quality audio content for various applications, including **IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems**, **podcasts**, **presentations**, and more.

The application provides a user-friendly interface for selecting audio files, adjusting mixing parameters like volume and music offset, managing audio output profiles, and previewing results. It leverages the powerful **NAudio** library for robust audio processing.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Voice & Music Mixing**: Combine a primary voice recording with a background music track
- **Flexible Audio Input**: Supports common audio formats like WAV and MP3 for both voice and music
- **Volume Control**: Independently adjust the volume levels for voice and music tracks
- **Music Offset & Fade-Out**: Set a start delay for background music and define a smooth fade-out duration for professional endings

### üéõÔ∏è Audio Profiles
- **Custom Profiles**: Create, save, and manage custom audio output profiles (sample rate, bit depth, channels, max file size)

### üîß Advanced Features
